                                                                                       ----------------------------------------------------

            When we are thinking about internship .Me and my firends got an offer to do internship in vizag,.Firstly, we feel how it would be there,then when the time came  we along with friends ,came to vizag.When we step down from railway station we seen a pleasant environament which attracted us very deeply to live more days

           Even though it is summer , we feel cool enviroament and as soon as we step down we reach our destiny and then we went to work place .The working environament is very well and we don't had any problems .

         We are worried whether there will be tourist places or not but all such ideas are vanished from our mind when we know that beach is near to ur working place . so,after our work we along with friends visit it and we enjoyed that cool breezes .

         We got little bit idea about the important places nearby locality and we thought of visiting that places, When we got leisure time we thought of going to that fun. With all these we should agree to that VIZAG it means THE CITY IF DESTINY.

           I hope evreryone try to visit and have the view of its wonderful environamental standards.
