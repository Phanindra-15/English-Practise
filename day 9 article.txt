                -------------------------------------------------------------

                 As we all know that ,in our life time we all experienced the usage of plastic  very commonly.where we it will helpful to us to keep things and carry things from one place to another in easy way but the main problem occurs when we throw it .
    
                 Every individual throws plastic wastage as soon as he or she completed using it.There the problem occurs  as plastic is not bio degradabale and it absorbs in soil layer then the water may not go underneath the soil .So,the future generation might have water scarcity problem.

                In order to this, we need to understand our future generations and we keep on reducing the usage of plastic.Recently ,i seen that Vizag is implementing this rule widely. where ever  we see near petrol  bunks,shops and malls they are not allowing any customers using plastic cover  and bottle usage.

                This can be prevented in many ways,but it is not the individual who can solve the problem but it is everyone responsibility to give a good and sustainable environament to our future generations 
 
                Government should also create awareness among public in order to ban usage of plastic and they should warn plastic discovery places and industries etc etc....
