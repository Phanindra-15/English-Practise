                                  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

            In any development of an application or a product  or any other item mostly many people will directly involved in building the specific product.Acoording to me, this process is quite unnatural and i wont support it as we should know what we are going to build .
 

          Suppose take a example of a civil engineer . when he got an order to build any specifc type of invention firstly he or she not just start the building of an application  .They make their ideas in a document like blueprint and with that idea they will move for further process.

            In the same for any process firstly we need to build the documentation then we should build it . The main goal of this is we need to know the idea about what we are going to do so maintain a documentation of it then move on to the further process

            So make a process of writing our ideas in document format rather than implementing them directly.It make us achieve our desired goal easily and very fastly  . It reduces time complexity that is been used by specific application.
