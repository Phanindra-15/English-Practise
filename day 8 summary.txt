                         ---------------------------------

              
                     As a student we used to learn many subjects when ur doing graduation but many of them think that it is enough if they pass in the exam.But,we should know that there will be an individual use for each and every concept .Students need to grab that minor advantage too and try to understsnd the topic rather thinking on how to pass the exam
 
                      In these aspects when they think to pass the exam rather than understanding the concept .In future there may be any use of the specific concept that we studied only for exam in these times to know about that topic we need to relearn the same topic as we forget the functioning of it .So rather than looking for an exam be focussed on understanding the concept so it might help in the future purpose

                      There is no problem if we relearn the topic but sometimes revising the topic that we already know may lose our confidence levels that  we forget what we learned.
                     There are some intresting steps in understsnding concepts in easy way
            
                   1.  First,Learn the notes.
                   2. Second,make it more intresting.
                   3.Play the tune in it so that it will be more intresting to undertand.
                   4.They relearn it for the second time so that it will struck in our mind.
